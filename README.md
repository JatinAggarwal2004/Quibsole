# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman! This is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a word letter by letter within a certain number of attempts. This project is a simple implementation of Hangman in [language of choice].

## How to Play

1. Run the game.
2. The program will randomly select a word, and display a series of dashes representing each letter of the word.
3. Guess letters one at a time.
4. If your guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position(s). If not, you'll lose one of your attempts.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

## Features

- Random word selection.
- Display of guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Feedback on whether guessed letters are correct or incorrect.
